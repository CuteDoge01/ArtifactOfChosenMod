# Artifact of Chosen

This artifact is a fun extension of the ZetAspects mod, if activated a random player gets to play with a random aspect each stage. This adds variability, lets you play with interesting aspects in different situations and makes multiplayer with friends more fun. Because aspects make it easier to play you can play on a higher difficulty to compensate.

There are additional aspects in ZetAspects if you are playing with GoldenCoastPlus, Aetherium, or SpikeStrip, those are supported here too.

This is my first mod, the mod is simple, but if you have any problems/suggestions please let me know in Discord: CuteDoge#1511
